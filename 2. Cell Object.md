## So what is a cell object?

Cell objects have these properties:

- `rotation` and `direction` to access the rotation integer (set + get)
- `suppressed` to access the retrospective value (set + get)
- `x` and `y` to access cell coordinates (get only, see SetPosition() below)
- `cellType` to access cell type integer (get)
- `name` to access cell name (ID for modded, tool name for vanilla) (get)

and these functions:

- `Push (int dir, int bias)` pushes the cell. Returns a table of 2 values `bool PushSuccess, bool DeletePusher`.
- `Delete ()` deletes the cell.
- `Rotate (int amount)` rotates the cell by an amount.
- `SetPosition (int x, int y)` changes the cell position. Note this will delete a cell at destination coordinates if the spot is not empty.
- `Clone (int x, int y, int dir)` clones the cell at new position and rotation.
- `Setup (int x, int y, int dir, bool gen)` resumes the setup code. Don't use outside Setup() or on other cells.
- `GetCell (int dir, int amount)` gets the cell `amount` cells away in `dir` from current position, and return a cell object.


### Now this sounds very scary, but lets show an example on a generator:

```lua
ref = this.GetCell(this.rotation, -1) -- gets the cell behind
new = this.GetCell(this.rotation, 1) -- gets the cell infront
if (ref.cellType == -1) then return end -- if the back is empty, end early
newX = new.x
newY = new.y
if (new.cellType ~= -1) then -- if the spot infront is occupied (~= is "not equals" in lua)
  moveresult = new.Push(this.rotation, 1) -- push the cell forward to free up space
  if (not(moveresult[1])) then return end -- push failed, we can't get free space. (lua table indexes start with 1 instead of 0)
end
ref.Clone(newX, newY, ref.rotation) -- clone the back cell
```
