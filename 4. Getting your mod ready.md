By this point you should be done with your mod. We are gonna discuss how to name it, where and how to share it.

Go into your mods folder. I recomend you name your textures and `.lua` files the same. Test your mod and make sure it works properly.

After that, zip everything you need (a single zip doesn't have to contain exactly one mod - you can make modpacks of any size!)

I recommend sharing your mods in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GQ6BAY8GdG), there is a special forum created for it.

Create a post with the full version of your cell name, put a brief description and upload your zip.

Done!

Of course, you don't have to follow any of that. There are no guidelines on how to do anything. Go wild!
