## What are mods?

Mods for Schemacell are written in Lua, so they are a `.lua` file. You don't have to have lua installed.

To install a Schemacell mod, just put your `.lua` file into `_Data/cells` folder, similar to texturepacks.

Along it you will need to put the cell texture.

## Mod Structure

Lets look at this example for a fast mover cell:
```lua
name = "Fast Mover"
id = "FASTMOVER"
author = "Milenakos"
texture = "fastmover.png"
updateAfter = "MOVER"
-- updateAfter = "CWROTATER" etc
-- if more than one mod wants the spot, sort reverse-alphabetically
-- if not set, updates last

function Step ()
    this.Push(this.rotation, 1)
    this.Push(this.rotation, 1)
    this.suppressed = false
end

-- this code is taken from mover cell without changes.
function Push (dir, bias)
    if (this.suppressed) then
        return this.Push(dir, bias)
    end

    if (this.rotation == dir) then
        bias = bias + 1
    elseif ((dir + 2) % 4 == this.rotation) then
        bias = bias - 1
    end
    return this.Push(dir, bias)
end
```

There are 2 sections - the mod metadata and the functions. Lets get into them in detail.

### Metadata section

Metadata section is a section with some of the information about your mod, typically at the top of the file.

This includes cell name, ID, author, texture and update order.

In Schemacell, all cells are technically tracked, so keep that in mind or something.

### Function section

This is the main juice of the mod.

You can create multiple functions which will run at different times of the game, including:

- Push (int dir, int bias) - called whenever cell is pushed. Should return `bool PushSuccess, bool DeletePusher`. First one says wether pusher should move, second whether it should be deleted. This can also be returned by calling another `Push` if want to mimic behaviour of other cell.

- Setup (int x, int y, int dir, bool gen) - called whenever cell is created (either placed by user or generated if gen is true, not to be confused with simulation start). If used should call `this.Setup(x, y, dir, gen)` at the end to continue basic setup process.

- Delete (bool destroy) - called whenever cell is requested to be deleted. If destroy is false cell is removed by user (so permanently), otherwise it got removed by other cell while in simulation.

- Rotate (int amount) - called whenever cell is requested to be rotated.

- Step () - called every tick

Now thats great and all, but how do we access information about the grid or actually do something?

Well, the actual cell is represented by using `this` keyword, which returns a cell object.

You can also use `Cell(int x, int y)` to get the cell by coordinates, which also returns a cell object.

Cell object structure is explained in the next file.
