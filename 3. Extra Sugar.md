## Grid class

Similar to `this`, there is a `grid` class, which has:
- `height` and `width` properties which get grid sizes (get)
- `tick` which returns the current tick number (get)
- `enemyCount` which allows you to control the internal number of enemies in the level (get and set)
- it also has `CreateCell (int celltype, int x, int y, int dir)` function to create new cells.

## Top-level functions

- `print (str something)` funciton will print stuff onto the screen, in bottom right corner.
- `CellID (str name)` function will convert given cell name into its ID.
