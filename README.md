## TL;DR

If you are here only to play mods made by others, then go to the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GQ6BAY8GdG) and head to #schemacell-mods channel. Download any of them you like, and extract it into the Data/cells folder, similar to texturepacks, except everything is in one big folder. Don't create subfolders in `cells/`.

## History

How some of you might know, quite a long time ago eclipse_m came up with the idea of Schemacell - a mod where you would be able to create your own cells using simple JSON. We got a bunch of promises, a name change to Schematell, and somehow it all ended up as a 2D platformer.

So, with the idea of Schemacell abandoned, people moved on.

Later on, I came up with that idea too and wanted to make it a reality. I first tried JSON - which didn't suceed due to lack of actual programming functionality. Then I tested C# to allow for direct copy of existing CMMM cells, which also didn't work out because C# is a compiled language, so I would have to get people to build their mods to DLL, which was the approach [Cell Machine Indev](https://themysticlynx.itch.io/indev) took. In the end, I settled on Lua - it is interpreted, simple to implement in Unity, has a good syntax and is known by many people (bc cellua hahah). And thats what Schemacell is running on right now.

Now after you are educated, lets make some cells shall we?
