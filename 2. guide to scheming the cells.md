mods are written in Lua. you don't have to have lua installed.

there are 3 main things to know:


metadata section
this is section with some of the info on top of the file
overrides
those are functions defined by you which are called by schemacell. can be Setup(x, y, rotation, generated), Push(dir, bias)*, Delete(destory), Rotate(amont), Step().
properties
generally, stuff is done with either this or Cell(x, y) classes.
they have: rotation, suppressed, x, y, cellType, name properties;
Push(dir, bias)*, Delete, Rotate(amount), SetPosition(x, y), Clone(x, y, dir), GetCell(dir, distance) methods.

there is also grid class which has height and width properties, along with CreateCell(celltype, x, y dir) function

top-level print(something) funciton will print stuff onto screen

*push returns a table of 2 values - whether the cell can move, and whether it gets deleted by doing so. this means you will need to make sure to return something. if you call external pushes you might use return cell.Push(), or manually returns like: return {true, false}

along with lua file, place a texture. zips are recommended.

unclear? there are some example mods which come with your game by default.
